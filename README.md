# GifTastic

### Overview
An dynamic webpage has been created with an array of gif images from the GIPHY API. The page contains 10 gif images that will become animated once the user clicks on a button. Once the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing. The rating (PG, G, etc) is displayed under every gif. 

### Instructions
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

**Have Fun!**
